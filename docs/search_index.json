This field has various practical uses, however the one we will mostly concern ourselves with in this report is its uses for exploratory data analysis and visualisation. When given data in a potentially very-high-dimensional format, we’d like to know a little bit about the structure of the data before applying any sort of machine learning methods. Often times, a small amount of domain knowledge can be extremely enlightening, and we can extract very useful hints about the sorts of analysis we may want to perform. This is interesting to me, because I personally feel that as off-the-shelf machine learning methods become more and more accessible, there is frequently an approach of “throw a bunch of models at the wall and see what sticks”, which can be time consuming and ineffective. By using dimensionality reduction techniques, we can help speed up this method-finding process, and become more intentional with our decisions as data scientists and machine learning engineers. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In this project, we’d like to what methods we have at our disposal for reducing the dimensionality of (potentially very high dimensional) data down to 2 dimensions for purposes of revealing structure while maintaining a clean visual for human-eyes and minimising information loss? We’ll explore various methods, using the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset (28x28 pixel, black-and-white images of hand-drawn digits 0-9) as our lab rat. As the data lies natively in 28x28=784 dimensional space, we will perform severe dimensionality reduction down to 2 dimensions, and attempt to work with animated 3-D plots for the latter part of the project. 2.2 Data availability There is no strict requirement that the MNIST dataset has to be used, and so there is a wide range of options for datasets. That being said, it’s a widely used dataset and is the topic of a large number of papers and analyses similar to that of the topic of this project. Information about the dataset can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and it can be downloaded from https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ or https://deepai.org/dataset/mnist. Containing around roughly 70,000 total images of digits handwritten by American Census Bureau employees and American high school students, the MNIST dataset has been modified to a standardised format of anti-aliased, black-and-white 28x28 pixels. Despite this modification being trace-able back to the source, there is also an option of using raw, unprocessed data.
